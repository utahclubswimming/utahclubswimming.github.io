# Records are stored in a hash.
# EVERY POSSIBLE EVENT NEEDS A ROW.
# A full event entry looks like:
#   - event: {{ Event Name }}
#     woman_name: {{ Woman Record-holder Name }}
#     woman_time: "{{ Woman Record-holder Time }}"
#     man_name: {{ Man Record-holder Name }}
#     man_time: "{{ Man Record-holder Time }}"
#
# Any field ommitted will simply be left out of the table automatically.
# Also note that the spacing must be consistent. Really. Don't break it.
