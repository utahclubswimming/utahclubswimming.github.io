    and turned to a life of dance. Chloe attended high school at the Salt Lake School for the Performing Arts with an
    emphasis in classical ballet and modern dance. Despite numerous hip surgeries, she continued to dance her way
    through life until she realized all she really wanted to do was get back into the pool. She started swimming with
    the team summer 2016 and has loved every minute of it. She plans to continue swimming and studying her way through
    college. Go Utes!
