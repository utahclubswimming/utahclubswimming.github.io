    Ina has enjoyed swimming for as long as she can remember, but she can also
    remember she likes eating more. Which led her to pursue competitive
    swimming, and ultimately with the Utah Club Swim Team. Besides that though,
    she also likes playing with cats even if they like to parkour off of her to
    get away. So when she's not chasing cats, she'll be with the team who won't
    climb on her, and she's more than thrilled to be a part of a team again.

    Melissa began swimming at the age of 8 and loves everything that has to do
    with water. As a stereotypical swimmer, Melissa cannot run. Therefore, when
    the zombie apocalypse comes she will be the first one caught. When Melissa
    is not swimming she enjoys reading, binge watching Netflix, and playing
    guitar. She doesn’t enjoy doing any of these things while swimming.

    Katierose is a Social Work major who has used swimming as a way to keep
    active, make friends, and enjoy competition ever since she was a young girl.
    Her dad put her in the pool to learn how to swim when she was 6 months old,
    and it caught on quickly. After some years she took a break from swimming
    and attempted diving, where at the age of 12, was ranked 11th in the North
    West age division Conference. However, her heart wasn't entirely in diving,
    so she returned to swimming.
