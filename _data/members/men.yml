    Sam has been swimming competitively for several club teams for eight years, four of which he also swam for his
    varsity high school team. Whether it's a morning practice with his current club team or four years (SSTY) or a
    regular high school practice, Sam meets each practice with the same determination and work ethic. In the same vein,
    Sam is always setting new goals for himself inside and out of the pool and always attempts to motivate his teammates
    along the way. Quiet and reserved at first, Sam becomes energetic and talkative once he is comfortable and familiar
    with his new team.
