    Ethan began swimming at the age of 13 and has loved the sport ever since. He
    trains hard so his younger brother doesn't pass him, but most of all, he
    enjoys competing and being with his teammates. Ethan also loves to run,
    which is concerning for a swimmer. His teammates are currently seeking help.
    When he isn't leading the best team in the world, Ethan enjoys hiking,
    camping, pasta salad, and being in the outdoors.

    exercise so he pursued the sport further through his high school team. This
    combined with his running and cycling compelled him to participate in a few
    short triathlons. He has continued his triathlon training through his
