During our recruitment, make sure to post any fun moments from this year or memories from past years on Facebook or
Instagram with the hashtag `#JoinUUCS`. The Marketing Board will be choosing the best one, and that person will get a
$20 credit on their team dues!

To finish, some of our current members have given us reasons why people should consider joining our team. Kevin
Hemmersmeier said, “Within the first week [I joined] I felt as if I found some great new friends and motivated people to
be around. Weeks later the people I met were great friends.” Our current Vice President, Connor Morgan, said, “The
highlights of my freshman season are the highlights of my freshman year.” Our Marketing Director, Megan Dearden, summed
everything up by saying, “I can only think of one word that truly encompasses the spirit of this team: family.”
