Over 160 swimmers from Utah and Colorado made their way to the
University of Utah this past weekend for the first annual Rocky Mountain
Invitational. This was our teams first big meet and we had a great
showing!

Out of the five collegiate club teams that swam, our team ended up
getting second overall! Not only did we have plenty of new seasonal best
times, but there were also lots of team records that were broken. As the
season goes on, it will be great to see how the team progresses since
we’re already doing so well this early on.

This was a great meet for competition and for getting to know the other
collegiate teams in the area. This coming weekend, our team will be
traveling to Boulder, Colorado to compete in the Buff Invitational
against a lot of the same teams, plus many others.

We’re sending a team of 20 athletes to the Buff Invitational, our
largest travel team yet! We may have two meets in quick succession, but
our team has worked hard and we’re ready for our first travel meet of
the season! Go Utes!
