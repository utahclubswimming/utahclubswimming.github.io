Our debut at the East Coast Collegiate Swim and Dive Club National Championships was truly a great one! Out of 80 teams, our women placed 36th and our men placed 31st for an overall place of 39th. Freshman Connor Morgan placed 9th in the 200 Back. Jarom Chamberlain placed 17th in the 200 Fly and 19th in the 100 IM. Xandra Pryor placed 15th in both the 200 Breast and the 100 IM. Over the weekend, we broke 18 team records, including an exciting 20th place finish for our Men’s 400 Medley Relay.

Among our athletes, there seemed to be a consensus that ECC Nationals was one of the most fun meets of the year. We had the opportunity to meet other teams, some as large as 200 strong. There really is nothing like Nationals, and we cannot wait until next year’s Nationals meet.

As our season comes to an end, we have one more meet left: the 2016 Northwest Zone Masters Championship Meet on Saturday, April 16th. We hope to see you all cheer us on at Olympus High School!
