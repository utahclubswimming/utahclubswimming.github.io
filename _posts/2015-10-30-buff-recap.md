On Saturday, October 24th, the University of Utah clocked an impressive meet at the University of Colorado – Boulder's Buff Invitational. The competition was steep, including teams from Kansas State, Colorado State University, and the 9-time national titleholder, University of Colorado – Boulder. Of the 15 contenders, our Utes walked away with a 5th place finish overall (4th place men’s and 5th place women’s).

Highlight swims included second place finishes from freshman Connor Morgan in the men’s 200 IM (2:09.49), and president Ethan Beseris in the men’s 100 fly (58.38). Freshman Megan Dearden picked up two second place finishes in the 200 IM (2:26.58) and the 500 free (5:52.51), making her the women’s high point from our team.

In our first full season meet, six new team records were set:

| Swimmer               | Event             | Time      |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Connor Morgan         | Men's 200 IM      | 2:09.49   |
| Connor Morgan         | Men's 100 Back    | 56.76L    |
| Janey Heyman          | Women's 100 Fly   | 1:12.26   |
| Jeppesen Feliciano    | Men's 100 Breast  | 1:06.09   |
| Megan Dearden         | Women's 200 IM    | 2:26.58   |
| Megan Dearden         | Women's 500 Free  | 5:52.51   |

Despite our 5th place finish, our squad of 11 athletes recorded the fourth highest number of top-five finishes in individual events, beating out the 4th-place finisher UNC, and trailing the 2nd-place finisher Mesa State by only one top-five finish.

| School | Individual Top-5 Finishes    |
|--------|------------------------------|
| UC Boulder        | 37                |
| Colorado State    | 13                |
| Mesa State        | 9                 |
| Utah              | 8                 |
| UNC               | 5                 |

These numbers suggest that our team is faster than what the meet results show. With more training and a larger travel squad, Utah is poised to make a strong debut at the National competition in April. If this weekend has taught us anything, it’s that the Utes are here to compete.

On behalf of all our officers and athletes, I would like to thank the University of Colorado for hosting an excellent meet. I was extremely impressed with the management quality and how their athletes conducted themselves, and I hope we will be able to work together in the future. Buffs, we’ll see you in Atlanta!
