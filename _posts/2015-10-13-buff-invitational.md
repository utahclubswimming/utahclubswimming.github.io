The Utes are \#BoulderBound!

On October 24th, the Utes make their national collegiate club swimming debut at the University of Colorado – Boulder. A dozen athletes will be representing our team at UC Boulder Swim and Dive’s Buff Invite, where they will compete against the nine-time defending national champions, among other collegiate club teams.

With a highly competitive season opener approaching, our athletes have been amping up their training regimen. Since our Red vs. Black Intrasquad Meet in September, we have been staffing practices twice a day, nearly every day of the week. Practices have been geared toward growing aerobic capacity in the water, as well as developing strong underwater and breath control capabilities. In addition, our strength and conditioning program launched this month, with a focus on heavy metabolic exercise that helps the body move stronger for longer periods of time.

Though we have our sights set on making an impact at the Buff Invite, we haven’t forgotten what this trip is really about. Travel meets are one of the greatest team building experiences in competitive swimming, and we are looking forward to the connections we will build on the road to Boulder. The only victory worth achieving is Victory Through Family.

The Utes depart for Boulder on the morning of October 23rd. If you see them around campus, wish them luck!
