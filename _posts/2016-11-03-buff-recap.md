Over the weekend our team traveled over 500 miles to get to the
University of Colorado, Boulder to compete in their annual Buff
Invitational. Not only did our team have a great time, but we also
performed well in the pool!

We sent 20 athletes to Boulder: 7 women and 13 men. For many of those
athletes it was their first travel meet with our team. Together, they
helped make up the largest travel team that University of Utah Club
Swimming has ever had!

Out of nine collegiate club swim teams, our team finished in third place
overall! And not only did we do well as a team, but we had some very
impressive individual swims. Sam Raber finished first in the 200
Freestyle and the 500 Freestyle, and Xandra Pryor finished first in the
100 Breaststroke. On top of those first-place finishes, we had ten other
top-five finishes in many other events!

Our team is continuing to work hard and is looking forward to the South
Davis Masters Swim Meet this coming weekend in Bountiful. In the past
two weeks, our swimmers have broken over eight team records, so as the
season continues we look forward to more best times and new records!
