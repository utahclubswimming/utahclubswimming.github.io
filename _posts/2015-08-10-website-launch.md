Welcome to the brand-new home of the University of Utah Club Swim Team! We're
very excited to be establishing our presence on the Internet in such a dynamic
and easy-to-relate way. Here is where you'll be able to turn to see all of our
most recent news, as well as anything else relating to the team.

At launch, our site looked like this!
![Website Launch]({{ site.image_url }}/blog/website_launch.png)

Some features
you may find interesting:

* Information about the team (our history, how to join, et cetera)
* Our practice and upcoming meet schedules
* Team all-time records
* Depth charts (which show the current top swimmers for each event)
* The team roster
* Personal bios on all of the Officers and Marketing Board members
* Contact information

Some features have not been implemented in the first release of the site, but I
intend to add them soon. Here's a short list of what's on the radar:

* Personal bios for each team member
* Fancier styling for Officers and Marketing Board pages
* More in-depth information about the various aspects of the team
* A page describing how this website was built

I really can't express just how excited we are to be bringing you more
information on a more regular basis. While we will continue to post to our
various social media accounts, consider this your home base regarding anything
and everything University of Utah Club Swim Team-related.

We look forward to seeing you in the pool!
