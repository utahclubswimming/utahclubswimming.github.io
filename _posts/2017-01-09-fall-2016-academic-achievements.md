Hot on the heels of a 5-win fall season, the Utes capped 2016 with some stellar
performances in the classroom. From a self-selected survey of athletes, the
fall 2016 average GPA was a 3.60, and more that 89% of the team achieved at
least a B average (3.0). Many athletes are pursuing rigorous majors,
including 15 in engineering and 10 in biology.

In addition, approximately 20% of athletes are members of the Honors College.
The average Utah Club swimmer worked over 10 hours per week and took 15 credit
hours in the fall 2016 semester. Most significant was team members receiving a
whopping average of $3,881 in academic scholarship money in the past semester.

We are extremely proud of our swimmers for their academic achievements in fall
2016, and commend them for fully embracing the title of student-athlete!
