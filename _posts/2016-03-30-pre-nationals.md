The time is finally here, Utah fans! This Friday, April 1st, marks the first day of competition at the East Coast Collegiate Swim and Dive Club National Championships, where 11 Utes will represent the University of Utah. The team has put in a hard semester of training to prepare for a strong national debut, and we are very excited about the roster of highly competitive athletes traveling to Atlanta.

Returning meet veterans and record holders include Melissa Hofmann (100 free, 50 back), Connor Morgan (200 IM, 100 back), Ethan Beseris (100 free, 100 fly) and Jeppesen Feliciano (100 breast, 200 breast). Our men’s and women’s relays are boosted with the addition of sophomore Xandra Pryor (breast, fly and IM) and first-year Jarom Chamberlain (fly, free and IM), who also look to make a big impact in their individual events. For a complete listing of events, athletes and times, see below!

Most importantly, we look forward to celebrating our hard work in Atlanta, and building connections with the swim community. The Utes could not be more excited for their first national championship!
