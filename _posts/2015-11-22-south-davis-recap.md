It has been a hard three weeks of hard training since the Buff Invite, and it has certainly shown! On Saturday, November 14th, the Utes recorded their first win of the season against the Utah State Aggies. The competition was fierce, but Utah was able to top USU by a sizable margin of 147 points.  

* Combined Team Scores
    - Utah: 901
    - USU: 754
* Women's Team Scores
    - Utah: 365
    - USU: 310
* Men's Team Scores
    - Utah: 536
    - USU: 444

We had a number of mentionable swims, including eight first-place finishes and six new team records.

| Dearden, Jamora, McMahon, Hofmann | Women’s 200 Free Relay | 1:50.73 |

Of course, there were countless other incredible swims that the stats won’t show. The Utes are taking on a tough training regimen focused on refining stroke mechanics in the water and power lifting out of the water, not to mention the impending conclusion of the academic semester. Despite being fatigued, Utah was able to bring home a win against the Aggies, and we are looking better each day for the big meet in Atlanta.

We would like to thank the South Davis Masters Team for hosting a great meet, and congratulate the Masters community on their swims this weekend. We would also like to recognize the incredibly competitive team from Utah State University, and thank them for a great meet this past weekend — we are looking forward to our season together. Stay tuned for the next Utah v. USU match-up in January!
