The recruitment week schedule has been changed somewhat! The principle difference is that we have swapped the Wednesday and Thursday activities, and Thursday's barbecue is now specifically a tailgate event to celebrate the first home football game of the season. Here's the updated flyer:

Active members are asked to attend one of the pre-recruitment-week briefings. There are two sessions available:

* Friday, August 21 from noon-1:00pm in the Marriott Honors Community ([Facebook event link](https://www.facebook.com/events/1485816425047594/))
* Saturday, August 22 from 10:00am-11:00am in the Marriott Honors Community ([Facebook event link](https://www.facebook.com/events/150812175253589/))

"Active members" refers to those members who paid dues in the spring semester and are currently listed on [the roster]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/). We like the rest of you, but it is these members that we are asking for help in distributing information regarding team activities.
