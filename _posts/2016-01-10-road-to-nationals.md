While the rest of the University was on break, our athletes kept working. All across the nation, the Utes engaged in a variety of winter break training activities, from swimming, lifting, and yoga. 

With a full semester of meets ahead, the team is training harder than ever to achieve their goals and compete. In just two weeks, we have another match-up against Utah State University, on Saturday January 23rd, followed by the annual QUAC Ski-n-Swim and Olympus Spring meet. And of course, at the beginning of April, Utah packs their bags for the East Coast Collegiate Swim and Dive Club National Championship in Atlanta, GA, where we will make our entrance onto the national competition scene.

We are also excited to welcome some new athletes to our team in the spring semester. For those looking to join the team, we will be tabling in the George S. Eccles Student Life Center this week on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, from 3PM-5PM, and at Plazafest in the Union Ballroom from 10AM-2PM. In addition, we will be having a team information session on Wednesday, January 20th, from 5PM-6PM in The Hub at the Student Life Center. Stop by and hear more about how to become a part of our swim family!

Returning athletes and newcomers alike, we hope you will join us on the Road to Nationals! All you need to do is come to a practice, and start working your way toward greatness.
