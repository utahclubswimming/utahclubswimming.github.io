                            Utah Club Swimming is a co-ed, intercollegiate, competitive, and student-run swim team at the
                            University of Utah. Any currently matriculated student at the University of Utah is eligible to
                            participate, regardless of ability. Practices are held six days a week and are non-mandatory, but
                            highly encouraged. They are hosted by our student officers, who act as both workout leaders and
                            technique coaches.

                        <p>
                            As of Fall 2015, our team competes in local meets through US Masters swimming. Competitors at
                            these meets include Utah State Swimming, Boise State Club Swimming, and other area US Masters
                            teams. We compete roughly once per month, with schedules announced at the start of the year. The
                            season concludes with a trip to the East Coast Collegiate Swim &amp; Dive National Championships
                            in Atlanta, Georgia.

                            The University of Utah Club Swim Team was founded in the summer of 2014 by
                            Ethan Beseris, who would serve as the team's first President. Joined by Vice
                            President Matt Bird, Men's Team Captain Jeppesen Feliciano, and Women's Team
                            Captain Melissa Hofmann, the "Founding Four" sought to bring the sport of
                            competitive swimming to all students at the University of Utah. They believed
                            that success in the sport is determined not by an individual's talent, but by
                            their willingness to achieve. It is this principle that our team is founded on,
                            that no task should ever be impossible, provided you have the passion and the
                            determination to accomplish it.

                            The second year of the University of Utah Club Swim Team was a formative one,
                            as this paragraph will surely explain at some point.
