                            The University of Utah Club Swim Team is a co-ed, intercollegiate, competitive, and student-run
                            swim team at the University of Utah. Any currently matriculated student at the University of Utah
                            is eligible to participate, regardless of ability. Practices are held five days a week and are
                            non-mandatory, but highly encouraged. They are hosted by our student officers, who act as both
                            workout leaders and technique coaches.

                            As of Fall 2015, our team competes in local meets through US Masters swimming. Competitors at
                            these meets include Utah State Swimming, Boise State Club Swimming, and other area US Masters
                            teams. We compete roughly once per month, with schedules announced at the start of the year. The
                            season concludes with a trip to the East Coast Collegiate Swim &amp; Dive National Championships
                            in Atlanta, Georgia, hosted by the Georgia Institute of Technology.

                            The University of Utah Club Swim Team was founded in the summer of 2014 by
                            Ethan Beseris, who would serve as the team's first President. Joined by Vice
                            President Matt Bird, Men's Team Captain Jeppesen Feliciano, and Women's Team
                            Captain Melissa Hofmann, the "Founding Four" sought to bring the sport of
                            competitive swimming to all students at the University of Utah. They believed
                            that success in the sport is determined not by an individual's talent, but by
                            their willingness to achieve. It is this principle that our team is founded on:
                            that no task should ever be impossible, provided you have the passion and the
                            determination to accomplish it.
                        </p>

                            At the conclusion of the first successful season of the club swim team, there was
                            an election for new officers. Ethan Beseris remained president with his proven
                            Vice President Matt Bird as the leaders of the team, while officers Melissa Hofmann
                            and Jeppesen Feliciano became the team's treasurer and secretary, respectively. The
                            new team captains were Janey Heyman for the women's team, and Pierce Darragh for
                            the men's team. Together, these six officers set out to establish a long-lasting
                            framework for a stable team.
