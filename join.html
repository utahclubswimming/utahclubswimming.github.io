                        The tryout form of previous years has been replaced with a much simpler form. Just
                        show up to practice and an officer will explain the procedure to you!

                        The Defensive Driving Certification must be completed by all license-holding members
                        for safety reasons. Click the link and then put "University of Utah" for the agency.
                        Follow the instructions and answer the questions as you go. If you have any concerns,
