            Our practices are at the
            <a href="http://campusrec.utah.edu/facilities/">George S. Eccles Student Life Center</a> and
            the HPER Natatorium (which is also home to the school's NCAA team). Unless otherwise noted,
            practices take place in the pool listed below. You can generally find us on the pool deck
            about ten minutes in advance of the start of practice. Dryland practices usually meet at the
            track in the Student Life Center, but the final location may change depending on the workout
            as determined by the day's workout leader (pay attention to our official communications
            channels for more info on these).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the 2016â€“17 season, swim practices begin <strong>August 22nd</strong> and dryland
            practices begin <strong>September 13</strong>.

            The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/S4XKemyJQXA2">Student Life Center</a> is located just below
            Legacy Bridge and north of the Marriott Honors Community.

        <p>
            The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/c984G3Nu9MB2">HPER Natatorium</a> is to the south and west
            of the Student Life Center at the south end of the HPER complex.
